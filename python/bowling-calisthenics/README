I decided not to finish this one.  It was too weird trying to apply OO 
principles in a language where OO is not generally the accepted way to do
things.

To be clear, I don't really know the accepted 'pythonic' way of cleanly 
implementing a bowling solution, but I know that it's not what I'm shooting 
for with this excercise.

I'll probably try this again in java, or possibly C#.
